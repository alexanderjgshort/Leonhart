# Leonhart
## Overview
Leonhart is a custom embedded Linux board based on the Texas Instruments AM6231 SoC.

The goal of this design was to build a fully functional Linux system that utilizes the on board Silicon Labs MGM240P module to host Zigbee and Thread networks simultaneously for smart homes.

## Key Features
- TI AM6231 SoC
- 2 GB DDR4
- SiLabs MGM240P RF module
- 16 GB eMMC storage (HS200)
- MicroSD interface
- Ethernet (RGMII PHY)
- 32kbit EEPROM
- USB-A host port
- USB-C power input
- SoC JTAG/MGM240P SWD TagConnect debug interfaces
- SPI and UART header pins for extra peripherals

## Rev A Progress
### Working
- PMIC rails come up correctly
- U-Boot boot via UART
- DDR initialization and simple read/write commands
- eMMC detected and operating at HS200
- 25 MHz CMOS oscillator and dual channel buffer
- EEPROM communication
- USB-A controller
- Linux boot

### In Progress / Issues
- 5V -> 3.3V buck converter footprint issue. Separate 3.3V injection used to power board
- USB-C sending incorrect voltage
- Ethernet PHY not yet operational (most likely configuration issue)
- Linux boot on power up may have to wait until Rev B because of bodged power up sequencing
- On board MGM240P UART and SWD pinout is incorrect

## Bring-Up Notes

Progress Update #1 

During initial bring-up, a bench PSU was used and a large current draw was observed, which was then found out to be an issue with the 5V -> 3.3V buck converter footprint.

A temporary workaround involved:
- Injecting 3.3V from wall adapter into 3.3V header pin
- Using a USB-C breakout board to power the PMIC and remaining rails via a bench PSU

This allowed for successful validation of:
- SoC boot
- DDR initialization
- eMMC communication

Linux boot strategy: USB-A -> DDR -> eMMC -> DDR -> boot

Progress Update #2
- Successfully booted Linux (Arago distribution)
- Rootfs and U-Boot files copied to eMMC
- Successfully able to boot from eMMC

Progress Update #3
- Modified prebuilt ti-am625-sk.dts file with only UART pinmux (UART5) for my custom board, and build .dtb file from that, then copied it to eMMC
- Tested UART5 communication with Sparkfun Things Matter MGM240P and saw output on SOC UART terminal

Progress Update #4
- Had issue with USB C power showing incorrect voltage for 5V rail (2.2V), so I used the bench power supply for dummy power. I have found that the bodged 3.3V injection setup causes the 2.2V at the USB C VBUS pins, which prevents USB C from sending power. Without the bodged setup (correct 5V->3.3V buck converter footprint) in the next revision, USB C power should work as intended
- Created new Rev B branch and started revisions

Next steps:
- Get full communication with off-board MGM240P
- Boot Silicon Labs network stack
- Run Zigbee NCP and Thread RCP
